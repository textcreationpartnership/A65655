            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:47687:39"/>dressing for her and her son to eat and so to dye, by consequence of Gods promise that <hi>Elias</hi> should be susteined by her untill the end of three yeares and a half, <hi>Elias</hi> would first have a <hi>little Cake,</hi> and then he bid her <hi>make for her self and her Son;</hi> in hope of supply, which promised without an express, in as much as God commanded her to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stein <hi>Elias, Elias</hi> was bold to promise by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that God would sustein her and her son by continuance of the Meal and Oyl, and it continued according to the word of the Lord which he spake by <hi>Elijah</hi> (the Hebrew saith by the <hi>hand</hi> of <hi>Elizah,</hi> the hand lift up in Prayer) it was blessed as the word of the Lord which the faithfull and praierfull spirit of <hi>Elizah</hi> spake by consequence of reason deducing such hope out of Gods word though not express, The Lord made good the word of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant the Prophet, and so the widdow and he and her house did eat thereof many dayes. She affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded one meal to him, his ministery procured ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny meales to her and hers, and fed her with spiritual sweetning of hope for continuance of blessing to them and him, hoping so by consequence of Gods word in that the Lord said <hi>I have commanded her to sustein thee,</hi> the Lord of all using mercifully to bless them with sufficiency whosoever obey him commanding for good to the obedient; By conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence whereof <hi>Elias</hi> bid her <hi>not fear</hi> what she had feared, untimely death of her and her son together, Which the good affection of the Mother would have to survive after her decease for a living me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall of her Name and Kindred to posterity, but if he dye before her, her soul more dreadeth
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:47687:40"/>it than dying with her, which I bid her not fear: what will be said there among the Gentiles, where I bid her not fear, and that in thy Name O God of hope the Lord God of <hi>Israel?</hi> How shall thy name be Sanctified by thy Servant a fugitive from <hi>Israel,</hi> If I must be fugitive hence also from amongst the Gentiles? asking what to do with me there: Hast thou no blessings nor mercies for them by thy Servant? and he cried unto the Lord and said, <hi>O Lord my God, Hast thou brought evill upon this Widdow with whom I sojourn by slaying her Son?</hi> Is it for evill? And not at extreme opportunity rather for greater good in thy rich Mercy? Mercy thou treasurest up for them that dwell in thy blessed enjoyment for everlasting; But would not that be more loved and thy name magnified if here were an outward token of thy gracious dealing with thy Servant sent hither as on purpose that thy Glory may shine among the Nations? in hope of which desireable among the Nations, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of such hope <hi>Elias</hi> cryed unto the Lord and said; <hi>O Lord my God, I pray thee let this Childs Soul come unto him again; And the Lord heard the voice of</hi> Elias, <hi>and the Soul of the Child came into him again, and he revived.</hi> This Christ called to mind in that his Catechisticall Lecture after Baptism, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. When he said the word Prophetiquely foretold was that day performed, by consequence whereof the Church of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles hopeth good intended thereby to her young Children in Christ his fullfilling his prayer at Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, being more powerful &amp; his heart more pittiful in joyning his effectuall prayer with the prayers
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:47687:40"/>of tender-hearted mothers, &amp; the prayers of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in tenderness of Spirit as Mothers to beget a new life of the Spirit, as <hi>John</hi> Baptist in the spirit of <hi>Elias, Elias</hi> procuring Oyl for preservation of the Childs life, &amp; restitution of life after death, By con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence hope much more in Christ the Lord both of <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and the Lord of Life and Death; Christ his promise being express for grant of the Spirit unto Children upon the prayers of Parents whose Spirit is the more rooted in themselves ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, like as this Widdow of <hi>Sarepta</hi> procured the continuall Supply of Oyl to Her self and her son by continuall dependance on the word of God sent by <hi>Elias,</hi> though not express; but in this by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of good reason in prayer Our Mother Church Ministery promiseth in Christs name the Spirit like Oyl to the Children of faithfull Parents at Baptism: Which some divert, abhor, and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme, and in that blasphemy forsake the Mother-Church of <hi>England</hi> and her baptism, and her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery for so baptising Infants.</p>
                  <p>Thus while they refuse to beleeve the Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Spirit at Infant-Baptism, their faith faileth about their own Baptism, that Oil ceaseth to them and their Children by their own confession, and so they run into the Wilderness after new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises: God in mercy call back, or hold us and others back from following them, and make us faithfull and thankfull for the Graces of our Baptism, and dutifull in performing the vowes and promises thereof in forsaking the Devil &amp; all his workes, that the Devil may have no more power over us or ours, in sinfull waies of the world or flesh; that we

                  <p>Christ in this (4 of <hi>Luke</hi>) after Baptism mindeth of two more Prophetique Instances, both from the figurative service of <hi>Elisha</hi> by his <hi>double portion</hi> of <hi>Elias</hi> his <hi>Spirit,</hi> designed chief in succession of his Ministery; the first implyed, the second expressed: that implied was of the like success in restitution of life by that succeeding Minister at the like im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate intreaty for a Child; and if you will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther minde the other widdow complayning that she and her sonnes were to be sold to pay the debts of her husband (a Sonne of the Prophets) by mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all interest of Parents and Children as One; by consequence whereof as Children were liable to suffer towards discharge, of their Parents debts, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents ought to have prevented the Childrens suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings by discharge of those debts, those debts being discharged by the Oyl figurative of Grace; By conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence the Parents ought to have provided, &amp; one failing, the other ought &amp; did by prayer with <hi>Elisha</hi> provide for the Childrens redemption, in event by Oil then, by Grace now in Christ redeeming Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from the debts of their parents faults: and bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing vessels from their Neighbours houses, that they also might bee filled as with oyl of <hi>Elisha,</hi> with grace of Christ.</p>
                  <p>That other expressed was of <hi>Naaman</hi> (helped by direction of a good with from his wife her captive little maid) a noble instance of hopely probability by divine Providence as it were on purpose apted for the great <hi>Syrian, Assyrian, Scythian,</hi> or <hi>Barbarian,</hi>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:47687:41"/>all one in Christ, not to disdain helpers bond or free, since God the Holy Ghost hath sanctified the duties of Servants to their Masters 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.1. and the faithfull wives 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16. to win their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands unto the honour of his Holy Name, and powerfull doctrine by Ministeriall intercession of <hi>Elisha</hi> for that Leper whose flesh became like the flesh of a young child by washing in <hi>Jordan,</hi> where Christ was to be baptized, for accomplishment of his Mysticall washing away sinnes both of old and young, as the children of <hi>Israel</hi> young and old pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed through <hi>Jordan</hi> into the land of promise in fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of Christs Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>The figurative passage of Mercy for Children at <hi>Jordan,</hi> where the spirit of <hi>Elias</hi> &amp; <hi>Elisha</hi> both in pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing were discerned by the children of the Prophets. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2. A lesson of the Spirit of Prophesie look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing toward the Spirit <hi>Elias</hi>-like in <hi>John</hi> Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing at <hi>Jordan,</hi> under Christ his Almighty Spirit for Sanctification of Baptism, Originally there, where the waters were so divided for passage of safety to the glory of the Spirit <hi>[And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan]</hi> This solemne Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition was not in vain at the beginning of the 4th. Chapter of <hi>Luke</hi>'s Gospel, where Christ pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth the mention of these Prophets <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Elisha</hi> sent to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> against the malignant <hi>Jews</hi> ready there to have cast him down head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long from the brow of the hill whereon there Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was built: perverting to evill in envy toward the <hi>Gentiles</hi> what Christ intended for mercy both to <hi>Gentiles</hi> and <hi>Jewes</hi> in favour of our purpose. Thus the Spirit of <hi>Elias</hi> rested in <hi>Elisha,</hi> and <hi>John</hi>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:47687:42"/>Baptist came in the spirit of <hi>Elias</hi> a Fore-runner of Christ the Lord of the same spirit baptized at <hi>Jordan</hi> being Author of Baptism and ordainer of Sanctification through the same Baptismal Spirit of Unity to his Glory.</p>
                  <p>The Spirit of <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Elisha</hi> was efficacious by prayer for mercy to young Children of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Spirit of <hi>John</hi> Baptist was the Spirit of <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Elisha.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore the Spirit of <hi>John</hi> Baptist was a Spirit efficacious in prayer for mercy to young Children of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Strength of this increaseth by Christ his praise of <hi>John</hi> Baptist as more than a Prophet: And therefore his spirit by neerness unto Christ, likely to be more efficacious in prayers for mercy both in Power and Act of essicaciousness as at fulfilling, <hi>This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your eares, Luke</hi> 4.21. about the Spirit anointing, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, and accepting, as the acceptable year of the Lord, accepting in mercy Young and Old; And this acceptableness in Spirit like sweet healing Oyl being mentioned by the providence of Christ (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed with the Holy Ghost) upon his bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing the great Messias anointed above his Fellows. <hi>Ps.</hi> 45.

                  <p>The Covenant is the same still in Essence though for the change of Circumstances (some ceasing and others succeding, as the Lord of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant willeth) it is for distinction sake called old in respect of the ceasing, and new in respect of succeding circumstances: The covenants be the same in essence, according to Gods Oath, <hi>Luk.</hi> chap. 1. 72. <hi>To remember his holy Covenant, the Oath which he sware to our Father</hi> Abraham <hi>that he would
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:47687:48"/>grant unto us:</hi> Gal. 3. The Gospell was preached before unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> when the Lord said, <hi>In thee shall all Nations be blessed,</hi> Gen. 12, and 22. <hi>By my self have I sworn saith the Lord, In thy Seed shall all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Earth be blessed.</hi> This is the Matter co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted.</p>
                  <p>And secondly the Form is an agreement sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, for though a promise might hold without a seal, yet when it is agreed to be sealed, then it is Null if it remain unsealed: God after his promise of Salvation willing to enter Covenant with man, for further assurance agreed to have it sealed by a token. And in that sense he called the token by the name of Covenant, as it were intimating the Covenant to be void if not sealed, as agreed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10, 11. <hi>This is my Covenant which yee shall keep betwixt me and you and your seed after you, it shall be a token of the Covenant betwixt me and you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After such agreement the token or seal is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Covenant, as essentiall to the Covenant, which if Papists would hear they needed not dream of Christ transubstantiated, the token as a seal assuring the benefit agreed on, though the matter of the seal be but circumstantiall, as in Contracts of men whether their seal be wood or brass. So the Covenant of God for our pardon ought to be sealed as covenanted, though whether the seal be flesh or water, that was a circumstance, changed, not at our pleasure, but as pleased the supreme heavenly power in pardoning.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly the Covenant being a relative agreement, the Correlatives are essentiall as agreed betwixt God
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:47687:48"/>and Man, correlative; Parents and Children, great and small, principally the small in truth of this clause in the agreement, the Child Christ being included: as the promise was made principally to the seed expressed alone, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. So the Covenant principally to Christ the Seed most blessed, and blessing others, the seed of the woman, the seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the seed of <hi>David</hi> covenanted in unity of Person to be God who covenanted with Man: the Son of God in unity of Person to be the Son of Man, sealed to be the Mediator betwixt God and Man, Parents and Children, great and small, sealed small as agreed by himself in his God-head covenanting with Man to be sealed in childhood, with obligation of duty to pay in fulness of time the ransome for Mans redemption at his death by the blood of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting Covenant to Justifie the circumcised in heart.</p>
                  <p>The mercies and blessings of the Circumcision in heart appertaining by Gods promise to young chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with their Parents upon their entring into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God as formerly proved, <hi>Deut.</hi> chap. 29. 11. &amp; 30. 6. the Covenant of love to be sealed inwardly by the Spirit, outwardly by Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, though the manner of that Seal were a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance, yet needfull, as commanded by God though diversly, first by Circumcision alone, at last by Baptism alone, but by both at the fulness of time to compleat all in Christ, who being circumcised was also to be baptized to fulfill all Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: all extendeth unto Jewes and Gentiles trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the steps of the faith of faithfull <hi>Abraham,</hi> sealed with the seal of righteousness by faith as
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:47687:49"/>beleeving Gods everlasting Covenant to be God unto him and to his seed as their God: That clause of the Covenant to be <hi>[their God]</hi> being the principall object of faith, as interessing him and them in Christ the blessed seed to bless all Nations and Families on earth to find righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in faith by Christ in that everlasting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for them and their Children sealed, as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> found Righteousness by faith for himself and his Children though sealed young, under Covenant of faith binding them in their appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted season also to beleeve in him unto their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, for which the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> said chap. 23. <hi>This is the name whereby he shall be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led [The Lord our Righteousness]</hi> in mercy so far exceeding the deliverance of Fathers with their Children out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi>

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:47687:49"/>the New seal unto which they have right through the former Seal of Righteousness by faith in God: The eyes of faith which saw the day-star of the Prophets in dreams and types, might and ought to have perceived this sun of righteousness arising, if they had not winked with their eyes, and yet boasted as if they saw reason in worldly policy, for which the wrath of God remained on them, and on their Children through unbelief refusing the righteousness of Christ at Baptism, that might and ought to have sealed unto them, and their young Children this essence of the Covenant, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending thus on that clause for sealing principally the young, otherwaies void both toward the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and toward their Parents.</p>

The Lord met <hi>Moses</hi> and sought to kill him: But upon circumcision of his son; <hi>Zipporah</hi> (by way of Plea in form of foederall claim) might say a husband of bloods thou art to me, and he (the Lord <hi>Jehovah</hi>) letting him go, she might faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:47687:50"/>aswell as of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> Ezek. 18. he profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing himself to come unto the <hi>lost Sheep of the house of Israel:</hi> By this light we may see to whom he sent his word of salvation by Baptism. <hi>Math.</hi> 3.5.

                  <p>Thus the presentment of Gods rich mercies (at performance of what he promised) ought not to lessen the parents hope of their Childrens benediction through the blessed seed as if now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sealed unto them in the new, though formerly sealed in the old Covenant.</p>

                  <p>The ground of such usuall figurative speech in holy Scriptures is not onely the likeness or simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude betwixt the sign and the signified, to help our weak understanding (that through visible outward things ascendeth more easily to consider of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly) but chiefly the coordination of them to help our faith, as by a seal to believe assuredly that by receiving the sign we have right also to partake in the benefit of the thing signified, by the good good will of our Saviour in his covenant of mercy coordeining the sign and the thing signified joyntly for the faithfull receiver.</p>

                  <p>Passively; Acts 1.14. <hi>These all continued with one accord in prayer,</hi> and chap. 2. <hi>They were all which one accord in one place on the day of Pentecost,</hi> when the Holy Ghost descended, and <hi>Peter</hi> said, <hi>This is that which was spoken of the Prophet JoelâRepent and be baptized, for the promise is to you and to your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>âfor applying the benefit of the promise, take the seal for assurance thereof.

                  <p>To which agreeth also the word of Faith ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on that other Prophetique testimony, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.20. <hi>I was found of them that sought me not, I was made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest to them who asked not after me,</hi> from <hi>Esaias</hi> 65.1.23, 24. <hi>They shall not labour in vain, for they the Seed of the blessed of the Lord, and their Budds or of spring with themâbefore they call I will answer,</hi> the next verse referring to the eleventh Chapter of <hi>Esaias,</hi> where at the Ensign (Baptism the Sign of Nations obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Kingdom) of Christ, Infants and Children sucking at the breasts, meet with Vipers, applied by <hi>John</hi> the Baptist at the time of baptizing, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.
